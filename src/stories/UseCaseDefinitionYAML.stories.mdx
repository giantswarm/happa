# Use case definition YAML

## Introduction

The _use case definition_ format is a specification developed by Giant Swarm. Its purpose is to express which Kubernetes RBAC permissions are required in order to fulfill a use case. Here, a "use case" is an activity that is meaningful from a user's perspective.

Example:

For more background information, refer to [roadmap#1049](https://github.com/giantswarm/roadmap/issues/1049).

The definition is used to configure happa so that users and admins can evaluate Kubernetes permissions with regard to the use cases defined. Without such a definition, RBAC permissions could only be listed individually (think of `kubectl auth can-i --list`), resulting in information that is very hard to translate into information that is meaningful for end-users.

As of April 2022, the definition resides only in happa (see [`scripts/permissions-use-cases.yaml`](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa/blob/main/scripts/permissions-use-cases.yaml)). In the future, we expect this file to be supplied to happa on a per-installation basis via configuration, so that the use case definition can be individualized for customers who require it.

## Example

Below is an example file defining some use cases.

```yaml
useCases:
  - name: Inspect namespaces
    description: List namespaces and get an individual namespace's details
    category: Access control
    scope:
      cluster: true
    permissions:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        resources:
          - namespaces
        verbs:
          - get
          - list
  - name: Inspect shared app catalogs
    description: Read catalogs and their entries in the default namespace
    category: App catalogs
    scope:
      namespaces:
        - default
    permissions:
      - apiGroups:
          - application.giantswarm.io
        resources:
          - catalogs
          - appcatalogentries
        verbs:
          - get
          - list
  - name: Inspect app catalogs
    description: Read catalogs and their entries in an organization namespace
    category: App catalogs
    scope:
      namespaces: ["*"]
    permissions:
      - apiGroups:
          - application.giantswarm.io
        resources:
          - catalogs
          - appcatalogentries
        verbs:
          - get
          - list
  - name: "Inspect releases"
    description: "Read workload cluster releases"
    category: "releases"
    scope:
      cluster: true
    providers:
      - aws
      - azure
    permissions:
      - apiGroups:
          - release.giantswarm.io
        resources:
          - releases
        verbs:
          - get
          - list
  - name: "Inspect clusters"
    description: "Read resources that form workload clusters"
    category: "workload clusters"
    scope:
      namespaces:
        - "*"
    permissions:
      - apiGroups:
          - cluster.x-k8s.io
        resources:
          - clusters
        verbs:
          - get
          - list
      - apiGroups:
          - infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io
        resources:
          - azureclusters
          - azuremachines
        verbs:
          - get
          - list
        providers:
          - azure
      - apiGroups:
          - infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io
        resources:
          - awsclusters
        verbs:
          - get
          - list
        providers:
          - capa
```

## Schema

A top level array named `useCases` is required. Each entry defines one use case.

### Descriptive metadata

Each use case consists of a `name` which should be unique if possible, and also short. More information can be given in the `description` field. The `category` field is used to assign each use case to a category, so that a hierarchy is created.

### Scope

Under the `scope` field we define whether the permissions for this use case are defined in the cluster scope, or in a particular namespace, or in any namespace.

Using `cluster: true`, we specify that the permissions are to be defined in the cluster scope. Example:

```yaml
scope:
  cluster: true
```

In contrast, if a use case's permissions are to be defined in namespaces, `scope.cluster` can be omitted or set to `false`. In addition, the `namespaces` have to be enumerated, or an `*` string must be used to indicate that the permissions can be looked up in any namespace.

Both examples below are valid.

```yaml
scope:
  cluster: false
  namespaces:
    - default
```

```yaml
scope:
  namespaces: ["*"]
```

### Providers

An optional providers field can be provided to indicate that a use case or a permission rule is only applicable for the specified providers.

### Permissions

Under a key named `permissions` we enumerate the rules that describe the permissions needed for the use case. The format used here is directly adapted from the [`rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/authorization-resources/role-v1/) API (specifically: the `rules` part) in Kubernetes.
