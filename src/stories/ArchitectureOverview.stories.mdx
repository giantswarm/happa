# Architecture overview

### What is happa?

happa is a client-side web application. Its purpose is to enable customers and GS staff to manage their workload clusters, install applications and define access and permissions for other users.

### How does it communicate with external services (such as the REST API or the Management API)?

It sends HTTP requests from the user's browser to that specific service.

### What language is it written in and which notable libraries does it use?

It's written mainly in TypeScript. There are still older parts that are written in JavaScript, but we stick to TypeScript for new code.
As for libraries, the UI is rendered using [`React`](https://github.com/facebook/react), and we use [`Redux`](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) for global state management.

You can take a look at [the code](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa).

### How does the architecture look like?

happa uses the MVVM architecture pattern.
