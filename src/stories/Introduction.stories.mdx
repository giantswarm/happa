# Welcome to happa&apos;s storybook

This storybook helps us build UI components in isolation from happa's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states.

A **story** is a component in a specific state.

In order to contribute stories, look out for existing

- `stories` folders under the `src` main folder, which contain all stories for a module/component
- `*.stories.tsx` or `*.stories.mdx` files in these folders

Find all existing stories in the sidebar.

To learn more about working with stories and storybook, check out the [documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs).
